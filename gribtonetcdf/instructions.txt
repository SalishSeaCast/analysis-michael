Instructions to run the grib_to_netcdf nowcast worker to reprocess the grib collection for WCVI

1) Set up the SalishSeaNowcast system following the instructions here
   https://salishsea-nowcast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_development.html

2) Copy wcvi.yaml to $HOME/MEOPAR/SalishSeaNowcast/config and edit paths as needed
   Ensure that the destination directory specified in wcvi.yaml exists ("ops dir")

3) Edit generatejobs.sh, uncomment the serial or parallel line in the loop

4a) If serial, simply run:

    bash jobs.txt

4b) If parallel, use the modified version of the nowcast worker
    "grib_to_netcdf.py" from this repo to replace the copy in

    $HOME/MEOPAR/SalishSeaNowcast/nowcast/workers

    ** Caution ** 
    The modified grib_to_netcdf.py here was checked out in March 2017, and you may need to re-apply the
    edits in the event that grib_to_netcdf.py has evolved. This commit shows the modifications:

    https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-michael/commits/45f004ff53f842be654a6352756f87ff7a462b09

    Now run the jobs in parallel with:  

    parallel -k -j 12 :::: jobs.txt
